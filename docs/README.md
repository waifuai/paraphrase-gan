# Docs

This directory contains documentation related to the project's architecture and design.

## Overview

This project utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate paraphrases. The architecture is designed with a feedback loop to iteratively improve the quality of the generated output.

## Architecture

The `ARCHITECTURE.md` file provides a detailed overview of the system's architecture. It includes a component diagram illustrating the key components and their interactions, as well as a description of the improvements made to the design.

### Key Components

*   **Data Preparation:** This component handles the preprocessing and preparation of the input data for the GAN.
*   **Generator Training:**  This component focuses on training the generator model, which is responsible for generating new data samples.
*   **Discriminator Training:** This component trains the discriminator model, which learns to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generator.
*   **GAN Training Loop:** This is the core of the GAN, where the generator and discriminator are trained adversarially.
*   **Quality Evaluation:** This component assesses the quality of the generated data using appropriate metrics and provides feedback to improve the generator and discriminator.

### Improvements

The architecture includes several key improvements over previous designs:

*   **Feedback Loop for Model Improvement:** The quality evaluation step provides feedback that is used to refine the generator and discriminator training, leading to better results.
*   **Clearer Separation of Training Phases:** The training of the generator, discriminator, and the overall GAN loop are clearly separated, making the architecture more modular and easier to understand.
*   **Explicit Quality Evaluation Step:** The explicit inclusion of a quality evaluation step ensures that the generated data is consistently assessed and improved upon.
